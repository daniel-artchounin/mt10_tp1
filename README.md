# Groups of order 4

In the context of the laboratories of the course Structure, formal calculus and algorithms (MT10) 
taught at Université de Technologie de Compiègne (UTC), via the open-source mathematics software 
SageMath, we have used some fundamental structures of the algebra (groups, rings, fields) in order 
to implement some cryptographic and coding algorithms. The code base of the first laboratory is 
inside this repository. It allowed us to use the groups of order 4.
